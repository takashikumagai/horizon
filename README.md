# Horizon

Horizon is a media player for Android OS. Its aim is to be a lightweight and fast media player app by focusing on specific needs rather than to be a complete all-in-one solution with an extensive set of features. For Horizon, the main focus is on playing media files on the user's local device, rather than streaming media over the Internet. One notable characteristic would be tabs for retaining the playback states of multiple albums/audiobooks. More about these in [Core Philosophies and Design Principles](docs/core-philosophies.md)
